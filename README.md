# JPEB Software

This repository contains all of the software we've written for the JPEB system.
The [common directory](https://github.com/b-Rocks2718/JPEB-software/tree/e03f12dd65c842f6b0d753c5ae66e2c69c57ea7b/common)
contains libraries for printing text, doing arithmetic that the ISA doesn't support (multiplication, division), and basic graphics like editing the tilemap.
